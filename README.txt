===== DEPENDENCIES =====

The only dependecies are 
 - OpenCV (http://opencv.org)
 - tinydir.h (https://github.com/cxong/tinydir) to provide platform independent listing
   of files in a directory and is included in src/contrib

===== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS =====

To build this you need:
 - cmake (http://www.cmake.org/download/)
 - A C++11 compatible C++ compiler (tested on GCC 4.8.2 and Visual Studio 2013)
 - OpenCV (tested on 2.4.10, http://opencv.org/downloads.html)

Build Instructions:
 - Linux: run
    cmake .
    make
	and, optionally, (sudo) make install
 - Windows (Visual Studio): use cmake to create sln file:
    In "Where is the source code" specify where you put the files
    (e.g. C:/Work/C/spixel)
    In "Where to build the binaries" say where to put binaries
    (e.g. C:/Work/C/spixel/bin)
    Press "Configure"
	Select the compiler (e.g. Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64)
	Press "Configure"
	In OpenCV_DIR Specify where opencv is installed 
	Press "Configure" and "Generate"
	Use sln file to build the binary (spixel.exe)	
	

===== USAGE =====

spixel executable takes three or four parameters
For "monocular segmentation" run it as

    spixel config.yml directory_with_images file_pattern

where config.yml is a configuration file in yml format where parameters of the algorithm are specified. For an example see examples/basic directory and run run.sh or run.bat file. Results appear in seg and out directories.

For stereo segmentation run it as 

    spixel config.yml directory_with_images file_pattern disparity_extension_pattern
	
For an example see examples/stereo directory.
Results appear in disp, seg, and out directories.

Descriptions of possible parameters are found in the two yml files.
